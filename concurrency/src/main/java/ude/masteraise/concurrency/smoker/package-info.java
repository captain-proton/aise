/**
 * <p>This package contains a solution to the cigarette smoker problem. Assume a cigarette requires three
 * ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of
 * whom has an infinite supply of one of the three ingredients â€” one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco,
 * another has paper, and the third has matches.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>There is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily
 * (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply
 * should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which
 * they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the
 * table. This process continues forever.</p>
