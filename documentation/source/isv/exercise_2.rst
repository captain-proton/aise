Critique to *ThemeRiver*
========================

Introduction
------------

*ThemeRiver: Visualizing Theme Changes over Time* written by Susan Havre, Beth Hetzler and Lucy Nowell introduces the prototype system ThemeRiver. ThemeRiver visualizes variations in themes and theme changes over time, with the use of a large collection of documents.
The idea behind ThemeRiver and the use of the river metaphor to show theme changes as a flow is designed in a high degree of abstraction. Trends, patterns and unexpected occurrence of topics are shown in a fluid way.

Summary
-------

The user needs that theme changes should be shown over time within a whole collection. ThemeRiver provides a macro-view of these changes of themes over a serial dimension. Unlike a histogram the user does not need to integrate the themes as they are displayed as a current inside the river, not in single bars. To highlight changes inside the river events are shown with markers at the date they occured.
After an usability evaluation ThemeRiver was improved in a second version. Users wanted some features a histogram provides, for example specific data on a date.
Altogether six sample diagrams and descriptions are used to describe the function of the system.

Evaluation
----------

Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main problem with ThemeRiver and its visualization form is, that it is not intuitive. The width on a specific point, shown as height inside the diagram, can easily be wrong interpretated on other dates. A current and its position at one point is always affected by "width" of the river. At some point a current has a high position, later a low position but the same width. If the user is not attentive enough a wrong value can be read, so a theme change occured as a consequent. But as the design is not meant to be highly accurate with exact values the user should be able to differentiate large widths.
Inside the diagram each theme is shown at one point inside the river, not in a legend. The number shown after the theme name is not described inside the document. In some figures the theme names of currents are missing.

Scientificity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside the introduction the authors describe states personal opinions near shakepear's themes change.
The system is reviewed by two users. No information is given on the qualification of the users. They may have information on the system that is written in the paper, thus have been influenced before they described their opinion. More users and reviews are required to get a more complete perception on the system.

Presentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The visualization is not well described. Portions of information regarding the diagram is spread ocross the complete paper.
Figure 2 is blurred and can not be clearly interpretated by the user. The information is more complete than inside the figures that contain the ThemeRiver diagrams.
In Figure 3 the dates above Jul 1990 from june to july are wrong. There is no 30th of july.

Conclusion
----------

If an user is provided with a description of the system it should be easy to interpret the diagrams. The *flow* of theme changes can be tracked, but additional information from the source documents is needed to interpret the changes correct. The combination of a histogram and the river shown in figure 5 may be the best solution to show a flow and highlight specific details.
